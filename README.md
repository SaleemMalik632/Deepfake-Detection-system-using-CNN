# Deepfake-Detection-system-using-CNN
This projects aims in detection of images deepfakes using deep learning techniques like  LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained RestNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features. For more details follow the documentaion.


# We Used this dataset for training and testing the model
